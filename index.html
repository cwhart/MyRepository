Inspired by the coastal area North of San Diego, where beach culture and the fish taco reign,
North County celebrates the cuisine and libations of Baja, California. Our focus is fresh,
healthy fare featuring seafood that is flown in daily along with the highest-quality local and
seasonal ingredients available.</p>
<p> North County’s carefully-crafted menu features traditional ceviches, oysters, mussels,
  tortas, salads and of course, a collection of the best fish and street tacos around – served
  on our homemade flour and corn tortillas. Our margaritas and specialty cocktails are all
  handcrafted using fresh squeezed juices and premium 100% Blue Weber Agave tequilas.
  In addition, North County offers an extensive wine list, more than 100 premium tequilas,
  craft beers from California and Mexico and spiked sodas batched and bottled on location.</p>
